This library allows a momentary switch to function as an on/off toggle
switch by checking for button press and changing the button state (and
handles button bounce).  This library also adds a method for delays that
also checks for button presses during the delay.

To install, find the directory used by Sketch > Import Library and unzip
the file into that directory.  The library will then show up in Sketch >
Import Library.  See TButton.h for the library interface details.

I used ideas from http://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial in
creating this library.
