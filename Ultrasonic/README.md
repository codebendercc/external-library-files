This Grove - ultrasonic sensor is a non-contact distance measurement module which works at 42KHz, suitable for projects that require middle distance measurement. 

**Note:**

This library is used for Seeed graphical programming Project only.


**Library Name**ï¼šGrove_Ultrasonic_Ranger 

**API**
---

	/* 
	 * Function Name: UltrasonicRangerRead 
	 * Input: PinName, pin to connect 
	 * Return: distance in cm   
	 */ 
	int UltrasonicRangerRead(int PinName); 

Test Case 
---

	Get data from then sensor per 100ms, and print to Serial monitor.   
	// test for seeed graphical programming project 
	// loovee @ 2015-8-4 
	 
	#include "Ultrasonic.h" 
	 
	Ultrasonic ultrasonic; 
	const int pin = 2;          // ultrasonic connect to D2 
	 
	void setup() 
	{ 
	    Serial.begin(115200); 
	    Serial.println("test for Seeed Graphical programming project"); 
	    Serial.println("Ultrasonic"); 
	} 
	 
	void loop() 
	{ 
	    int dist_cm = ultrasonic.UltrasonicRangerRead(pin);         // read data from ultrasonic ranger 
	    Serial.println(dist_cm);                                    // display it 
	    delay(100); 
	}
